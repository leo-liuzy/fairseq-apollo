(This is an area the size of Italy that we're talking about, not a lone reef on the edge of a small tropical island.) He hits his readers with every notion he can think of as an alternative to the actual cause of the mass coral bleachings described in Hughes17.

The landscape of digital media advertising continues to evolve with rapidly changing devices, ad technologies, consumer behavior, and business strategies. The laws governing such developments remain but must also adapt. Commercial laws govern the transactions between parties who buy, sell, optimize and measure ads.
