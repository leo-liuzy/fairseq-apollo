o ye who believe! slay not chase while ye are in a state of sanctity; and whosoever of you slayeth it wittingly, his compensation is the like of that which he hath slain, in domestic flocks, which two equitable persons among you shall judge: an offering brought to the ka'ba; or as an expiation the feeding of the needy, or the equivalent thereof in fasts, that he may taste the grievousness of his deed. allah hath pardoned that which is past, but whosoever returnoth, allah shall take retribution from him; verily allah is mighty, lord of retribution

will he who has a clear proof from his lord, which acts as evidence from him, before which the book of moses was a way-giver and a grace, (not believe in it)? whoever among the partisans does not believe in it shall have hell as the promised award. so have no doubt about it, for surely it's the truth from your lord, though most men may not believe.
