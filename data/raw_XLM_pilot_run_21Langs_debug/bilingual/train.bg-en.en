that is why it is so important and why , when we are looking to public authorities to continue investment in this time of economic crisis , this proposal is even more important than it was when i started this report a few month ago .
cross-border cooperation programmes are also important for being effective and achieving results when implementing strategies linked to poverty reduction and the integration of disadvantaged groups into european mainstream society .
