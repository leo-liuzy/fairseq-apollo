barring those who have faith, do righteous deeds, and remember allah much often, and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged. and the wrongdoers will soon know at what goal they will end up.
"our lord! make us not a (test and) trial for the unbelievers, but forgive us, our lord! for thou art the exalted in might, the wise."
and will return to his people full of joy.
they said: lo! we are sent unto a guilty folk,
and the companions of the left - what are the companions of the left?
then we forgave you after that so perhaps you would be grateful.
when the souls are paired.
and whether ye hide your word or publish it, he certainly has (full) knowledge, of the secrets of (all) hearts.
do not think that those who deny the truth can frustrate our plan on earth; their abode shall be hell; and it is indeed an evil resort.
and we have placed in the earth firm hills lest it quake with them, and we have placed therein ravines as roads that haply they may find their way.
(it will be said of such sinners), "seize them and drag them into the middle of hell.
and made them virginal,
and this (so that it may be clear) that your lord does not destroy towns and cities arbitrarily while the citizens remain unaware.
and if ye would count the favour of allah ye cannot reckon it. lo! allah is indeed forgiving, merciful.

(moses) said: "go hence! all your life you are (cursed) to say: 'do not touch me; and a threat hangs over you which you will not be able to escape. look at your god to whom you are so attached: we shall verily burn it, and disperse its ashes into the sea.
they swear by allah with solemn oaths that allah will not resurrect those who die. yes indeed [he will], it is a promise binding upon him, but most people do not know,
and it was revealed to nuh: that none of your people will believe except those who have already believed, therefore do not grieve at what they do:
by the night when it recedes!
the fire, to which they shall be exposed morning and evening; and on the day when the hour is come: 'admit the folk of pharaoh into the most terrible chastisement!'
believers, if you yield to those who deny the truth, they will cause you to turn back on your heels and you will turn into losers.
indeed, they deny something whose knowledge they do not comprehend, and whose explanation has not yet come to them. those who were before them denied likewise. so observe how was the fate of the wrongdoers!
they said: o our people! verily we have hearkened unto a book sent down after musa, confirming that which was before it, guiding unto the truth and a straight path.
and to thamood, (we sent) their brother salih. he said: 'my nation, worship allah; you have no god except he. it is he who made you from the earth and let you live upon it. ask his forgiveness then repent to him. indeed, my lord is near and answers (prayers)'
but if you desire allah and his apostle and the abode of the hereafter, then allah has indeed prepared a great reward for the virtuous among you.’
we divided them into twelve (different) tribes. when his people asked for water, we said to moses: "strike the rock with your staff;" and behold, twelve springs of water gushed forth, so that each of the tribes had a place of its own to drink; and we made the clouds spread shade over them and sent for them manna and quails (and said): "eat of the good things we have provided for you." but (by disobeying) they did not harm us, they harmed themselves.
all praise belongs to allah who created the heavens and the earth and made the darkness and the light. yet the faithless equate [others] with their lord.
exalted is he who carried his worshiper (prophet muhammad) to travel in the night from the sacred mosque to the furthest mosque which we have blessed around it so that we might show him some of our signs. he is the hearer, the seer.
he replied: 'the evildoer we shall punish. then he shall return to his lord and he will punish him with a stern punishment.
so the punishment overtook them. most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe.
and directed him: “go to pharaoh, he has rebelled,
(all) faces shall be humbled before the living one, the eternal. those who are burdened with wrong doing shall have failed,
"our lord! bring us out of this; if ever we return (to evil), then indeed we shall be zalimun: (polytheists, oppressors, unjust, and wrong-doers, etc.)."
except for those who believe, and do good deeds, and remember god frequently, and defend themselves after they are wronged. as for those who do wrong, they will know by what overturning they will be overturned.

but we saved him and his family, except for his wife; she was of those who lagged behind.
these are the verses of the clear book.

the forgiver of sin, the acceptor of repentance, the severe in punishment, the bestower (of favours), la ilaha illa huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but he), to him is the final return.
discard both the visible and invisible sin. for those who sin will be punished for what they have done.

(pharaoh) said: ye put faith in him before i give you leave. lo! he is your chief who taught you magic. now surely i shall cut off your hands and your feet alternately, and i shall crucify you on the trunks of palm trees, and ye shall know for certain which of us hath sterner and more lasting punishment.

you will find that the most people in enmity to the believers are the jews and idolaters, and that the nearest in affection to the believers are those who say: 'we are nazarenes' that is because amongst them there are priests and monks; and because they are not proud.
but not satan, who was too proud. he became one of those who deny the truth.
remember that morning thou didst leave thy household (early) to post the faithful at their stations for battle: and allah heareth and knoweth all things:
everyone on it must pass away.
then, you are those [same ones who are] killing one another and evicting a party of your people from their homes, cooperating against them in sin and aggression. and if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, although their eviction was forbidden to you. so do you believe in part of the scripture and disbelieve in part? then what is the recompense for those who do that among you except disgrace in worldly life; and on the day of resurrection they will be sent back to the severest of punishment. and allah is not unaware of what you do.
have they not seen how many generations we destroyed before them? they shall never return to them,

allah said: "by no means! proceed then, both of you, with our signs; we are with you, and will listen (to your call).

therefore, we will most certainly make those who are bent on denying the truth taste a severe punishment and we will most certainly requite them according to the worst of their deeds,

and when it is said to them, “beware of what is before you and what is behind you, in the hope of your gaining mercy”, they turn away!

so it was that we let them come upon them, that they might know that allah’s promise is true, and that there is no doubt in the hour. as they disputed among themselves about their matter, they said, ‘build a building over them. their lord knows them best.’ those who had the say in their matter said, ‘we will set up a place of worship over them.’

so when her husband saw his shirt torn from the back, he said, "indeed, it is of the women's plan. indeed, your plan is great.
but as for those who believe and do righteous deeds, we will admit them into gardens beneath which rivers flow, where they will abide forever. the promise of god is true—and who is more truthful in speech than god?

those who reject our revelations and are too arrogant to uphold them—the doors of heaven will not be opened for them, nor will they enter paradise, until the camel passes through the eye of the needle. thus we repay the guilty.
except the slaves of allah, whom he choses (for his mercy i.e. true believers of islamic monotheism who do not attribute false things unto allah).

when moses returned to his people, indignant and grieved, he said: "how wickedly you behaved in my absence. why must you hasten the decree of your lord?" and he cast aside the tablets, and pulled his brother by the hair. "o son of my mother," said (aaron), "these people took advantage of my weakness and almost killed me. do not let my enemies rejoice at my plight, and do not put me down among transgressors."

and you have already known the first creation, so will you not remember?
in order to admit the believing men and believing women into gardens beneath which rivers flow, in which they will abide, and to relieve them of their misdeeds; and this, in allah’s sight, is the greatest success.

so when you confront the disbelievers, strike at their necks; until when you have slain them in plenty, tie them up firmly; then after that, you may either release them as a favour or take ransom, until the war lays down its ordeal; this is it; and had allah willed he himself could have taken revenge from them, but this is to test some of you with others; and allah will surely never waste the deeds of those who were killed in his way.
and when they returned to their folks they would return amused,
and the scorch will be made apparent to any one who beholdeth.
[he] who created death and life to test you [as to] which of you is best in deed - and he is the exalted in might, the forgiving -
and his companion (angel) will say: "here is (this record) ready with me!"
and to say: what! shall we indeed give up our gods for the sake of a mad poet?
then afterward allah will relent toward whom he will; for allah is forgiving, merciful.
then he turned back and was proud.
glorified be he who carried his servant by night from the inviolable place of worship to the far distant place of worship the neighbourhood whereof we have blessed, that we might show him of our tokens! lo! he, only he, is the hearer, the seer.
their home will be the fire because of what they used to earn.
we recount to you with truth some parts of the story of moses and pharaoh for the benefit of those who believe.
those who received knowledge know that what is revealed to you from your lord is the truth; and it guides to the path of the majestic, the praiseworthy.
see they not that they are tried every year once or twice? yet they turn not in repentance, and they take no heed.
he said, 'o my lord, help me, for that they cry me lies.'

"and do not believe those who do not belong to your faith." say: "true guidance is the guidance of god -- that any may be given the like of what has been given you." will they argue with you before your lord? say: "god's is the bounty. he gives whomsoever he please, for he is infinite and all-wise."
and he brought perdition upon the subverted cities
ha mim.
even if they saw lumps falling from heaven, they would say, 'a massed cloud!'
we did not send any apostle except with the language of his people, so that he might make [our messages] clear to them. then allah leads astray whomever he wishes, and he guides whomsoever he wishes, and he is the all-mighty, the all-wise.
did i not commit you, o children of adam, not to worship satan who is your acknowledged foe,
he has the keys to the realm that lies beyond the reach of human perception; none knows them but he. and he knows what is on the land and in the sea; there is not a leaf which falls that he does not know about and there is not a grain in the darkness of the earth or anything green or dry which has not been recorded in a clear book.
o you who have faith! indeed wine, gambling, idols, and the divining arrows are abominations of satan’s doing, so avoid them, so that you may be felicitous.
“like the tradition of the people of nooh, and aad, and thamud and others after them; and allah does not will injustice upon bondmen.”
he said, “i have preferred the love of niceties to the remembrance of my lord—until it disappeared behind the veil.
surely those who do not expect to meet us, who are gratified with the life of the world and content with it, and are heedless of our signs,
yet they make some of his creatures his offspring! man is surely most ungrateful.
each one of them we seized for his crime: of them, against some we sent a violent tornado (with showers of stones); some were caught by a (mighty) blast; some we caused the earth to swallow up; and some we drowned (in the waters): it was not allah who injured (or oppressed) them:" they injured (and oppressed) their own souls.
"and surely, hell is the promised place for them all.
'moses, why have you come with such haste from your nation'
there came a man hurrying from the city outskirts. he said, ‘o my people! follow the apostles!
[more precisely], is he [not best] who created the heavens and the earth and sent down for you rain from the sky, causing to grow thereby gardens of joyful beauty which you could not [otherwise] have grown the trees thereof? is there a deity with allah? [no], but they are a people who ascribe equals [to him].
that is the ultimate extent of their knowledge. surely your lord knows best those who stray from his path and he knows best those who follow his guidance.
that is because those who refuse to believe only follow what is false; but those who believe follow the truth from their lord. that is how god gives men precepts of wisdom.
obedience and a gentle word (was proper); but when the affair becomes settled, then if they remain true to allah it would certainly be better for them.
and certainly some narratives have come to them wherein is prevention--
but those who fear their lord: theirs shall be the gardens beneath which rivers flow and in which they will live forever: a hospitality from allah himself, and allah's reward is best for the truly pious.
and wed not infidel women until they believe; of a surety a believing bondwoman is better than an infidel woman, albeit she please you. and wed not your women to infidel men until they believe; of a surety a believing bondman is better than an infidel, albeit the please you. these call you unto the fire, and allah calleth you unto the garden and unto forgiveness, by his leave; and he expoundeth his commandments unto mankind that haply they may be admonished.
they have found the guidance of their lord and will be successful.
thus, the transgressing people were destroyed. it is only god, the lord of creation who deserves all praise.
and deliver us, through your mercy, from the unbelievers.'
my lord! they have sent astray many among mankind; whosoever followeth me, verily he is of me; and whosoever disobeyeth me, then verily thou art forgiving, merciful.
they said, “we cannot find the king’s cup, and for him who brings it is a camel-load, and i am its guarantor.”
it is he who sends rain after they have despaired and spreads his mercy far and wide. he is the protector, worthy of all praise.
he said: 'i have no knowledge of what they have done.
and the companions of the madyan people; and moses was rejected (in the same way). but i granted respite to the unbelievers, and (only) after that did i punish them: but how (terrible) was my rejection (of them)!
say, "allah is most knowing of how long they remained. he has [knowledge of] the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth. how seeing is he and how hearing! they have not besides him any protector, and he shares not his legislation with anyone."
thus the truth prevailed and their false art was banished.
had the truth followed their desires, the heavens and the earth would have surely fallen apart [along] with those who are in them. indeed, we have brought them their reminder, but they are disregardful of their reminder.
fight them so that there will be no disbelief in god and god's religion will become dominant. if they change their behavior, there would be no hostility against anyone except the unjust.
and then what they were promised comes to them,
this is the true account: there is no god except allah; and allah-he is indeed the exalted in power, the wise.

hast thou not turned thy vision to one who disputed with abraham about his lord, because allah had granted him power? abraham said: "my lord is he who giveth life and death." he said: "i give life and death". said abraham: "but it is allah that causeth the sun to rise from the east: do thou then cause him to rise from the west." thus was he confounded who (in arrogance) rejected faith. nor doth allah give guidance to a people unjust.
[abraham] said, "then what is your business [here], o messengers?"
who give whatsoever they give (in his way), and their hearts tremble with fear that they have to go back to their lord,
instead, the disbelievers will be brought into the presence of god as the soldiers of the idols.
sister of aaron, thy father was not a wicked man, nor was thy mother a woman unchaste.'
allah chooses apostles from among the angels and from among the men; surely allah is hearing, seeing.
we gave moses and aaron the criterion of right and wrong and a light and reminder for the righteous,
because your lord has commanded it.
messenger, do not be grieved about the people who run back to disbelief. they only say that they believe but, in fact, they have no faith in their hearts. some jews knowingly listen to lies and accept the lies which come from others, (jews), who have no relation with you and who distort certain words of the bible and say to the people, "accept only those words which are the same as what we have told you. if you do not, then beware!" you can not help those whom god wants to try. god does not want to cleanse the hearts of such people. they lead a disgraceful life in this world and in the life hereafter they will suffer a great torment.
this is the example of those who disbelieve in their lord: their works are like ashes upon which the wind blows fiercely on a tempestuous day. they shall find no reward for their deeds. that indeed is the farthest point in straying.
we called unto him, 'abraham,
until ye come to the graves.
they were pursued by a curse in this world, and so will they be on the day of judgement. lo! 'ad disbelieved in the lord. lo! ruined are 'ad, the people of hud.

by no means will they escape (from allah's torment) on earth, nor have they protectors besides allah! their torment will be doubled! they could not bear to hear (the preachers of the truth) and they used not to see (the truth because of their severe aversin, inspite of the fact that they had the sense of hearing and sight).
do not say that those killed in the way of allah are dead, they are alive, although you are unaware.
the evil they perpetrated overtook them, and what they mocked has turned upon them.
he it is who created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then from a clot; then he brings you out as an infant, then causes you to grow into full maturity, and then causes you to grow further so that you may reach old age, while some of you he recalls earlier. all this is in order that you may reach an appointed term and that you may understand (the truth).

let not their words grieve you. surely we know all things about them, what they conceal and what they reveal.
it is we who created you and gave you shape; then we bade the angels prostrate to adam, and they prostrate; not so iblis; he refused to be of those who prostrate.
allah is the all-embracing.
there are some of them who prick up their ears at you, but we have cast veils on their hearts lest they should understand it, and a deafness into their ears; and though they should see every sign, they will not believe in it. when they come to you, to dispute with you, the faithless say, ‘these are nothing but myths of the ancients.’
(to be) a provision and benefit for you and your cattle.
has the story reached you of the hosts,
the love of [worldly] allures, including women and children, accumulated piles of gold and silver, horses of mark, livestock, and farms has been made to seem decorous to mankind. those are the wares of the life of this world, but the goodness of one’s ultimate destination lies near allah.
and had we willed we could have set among you angels to be viceroys in the earth.
and were it not that there should befall them a disaster for what their hands have sent before, then they should say: our lord! why didst thou not send to us an apostle so that we should have followed thy communications and been of the believers!

worship god: and do not associate partners with him. be good to your parents, to relatives, to orphans, to the needy, and the neighbour who is a kinsman, and the neighbour who is not related to you and your companions and the wayfarers and those whom you rightfully possess. god does not like arrogant, boastful people,
then we gave moses the book, complete for him who does good, and distinguishing every thing, and as a guidance and a mercy; haply they would believe in the encounter with their lord.
the thamud (people) rejected the messengers.
then is he who will shield with his face the worst of the punishment on the day of resurrection [like one secure from it]? and it will be said to the wrongdoers, "taste what you used to earn."
he has no partner, with that i am commanded, and i am the first of the submitters (muslims)'
they say, "if the all merciful had so willed, we would not have worshipped them." they have no knowledge of that. they are only conjecturing.
and allah hath given you, of that which he hath created, shelter from the sun; and hath given you places of refuge in the mountains, and hath given you coats to ward off the heat from you, and coats (of armour) to save you from your own foolhardiness. thus doth he perfect his favour unto you, in order that ye may surrender (unto him).
'peace be to you, for that you were patient' best is the ultimate abode.
those who spread lies were a clique among you. do not think that it was bad for you: in fact it has been good for you. each of them will pay for the sin he has committed, and he who had greater share (of guilt) will suffer grievous punishment.
who has taught (the writing) by the pen [the first person to write was prophet idrees (enoch)].
if god afflicts you with harm, none can remove it except he. and if he wants good for you, none can repel his grace. he makes it reach whomever he wills of his servants. he is the forgiver, the merciful.

say: "look at the compeers you invoke apart from god. show me, what of the earth have they created, or what share have they in the heavens?" or have we given them a book whose testimony they possess? not in the least. what the unbelievers have been promising one another is nothing but deceit.

we said, ‘get down from it, all together! yet, should any guidance come to you from me, those who follow my guidance shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
with him we subjected the mountains to give glory at evening and sunrise,
who has gathered riches and counted them over
and they ill-treated them for no other reason than that they believed in allah, exalted in power, worthy of all praise!-
surely we have made whatever is on the earth an embellishment for it, so that we may try them (as to) which of them is best in works.
and do not drive away those who call upon their lord, morning and evening, seeking his attention. you are not accountable for them in any way, nor are they accountable for you in any way. if you drive them away, you would be one of the unjust.
believers! do not ask of the things which, if made manifest to you, would vex you; for, if you should ask about them while the qur'an is being revealed, they will be made manifest to you. allah has pardoned whatever happened in the past. he is all-forgiving, all-forbearing.
now hath allah lightened your burden, for he knoweth that there is weakness in you. so if there be of you a steadfast hundred they shall overcome two hundred, and if there be of you a thousand (steadfast) they shall overcome two thousand by permission of allah. allah is with the steadfast.
except for those to whom god grants mercy. he is majestic and all-merciful.

the inhabitants of the city of medina and the desert arabs dwelling around it were not supposed to disobey the messenger of god or to give priority to their own lives above that of the prophet. for if they had given priority to the life of the messenger of god, they would not have experienced the hardships of thirst, fatigue, or hunger in their struggle for the cause of god, nor would their travelling have enraged the disbelievers and they would not have received any injury from enemies that god would not record for them as a virtuous deed. god does not ignore the reward of those who do good.
my son, be steadfast in prayer. make others do good. prevent them from doing evil. be patient in hardship. patience comes from faith and determination.
kaf ha ya 'ayn sad.
“nor any food except the pus discharged from the people of hell.”
i shall certainly cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides and crucify you all together."
verily those who live in awe for fear of their lord;
a servant when he prays,
lord of the throne, the all-glorious,
and when you recite the quran, we place between you and those who do not believe in the hereafter a hidden barrier;
those who follow the messenger, the prophet who can neither read nor write (i.e. muhammad saw) whom they find written with them in the taurat (torah) (deut, xviii, 15) and the injeel (gospel) (john xiv, 16), - he commands them for al-ma'ruf (i.e. islamic monotheism and all that islam has ordained); and forbids them from al-munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that islam has forbidden); he allows them as lawful at-taiyibat [(i.e. all good and lawful) as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.], and prohibits them as unlawful al-khaba'ith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.), he releases them from their heavy burdens (of allah's covenant), and from the fetters (bindings) that were upon them. so those who believe in him (muhammad saw), honour him, help him, and follow the light (the quran) which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful.
they said: bringest thou unto us the truth, or art thou some jester?
satan threatens you with poverty and commands you to commit sin. god promises you forgiveness and favors. god is munificent and all-knowing.
no just estimate have they made of god. surely god is powerful and mighty.
and worship instead of allah, those helpless beings who have no control over providing them any sustenance from the heavens and the earth; do you worship those who have no power to do anything of this sort?
certainly we sent our apostles with manifest proofs, and we sent down with them the book and the balance, so that mankind may maintain justice; and we sent down iron, in which there is great might and uses for mankind, and so that allah may know those who help him and his apostles [with faith] in the unseen. indeed allah is all-strong, all-mighty.
orchards and vineyards,
he said, “what my lord has empowered me with is better. but assist me with strength, and i will build between you and them a dam.”
who will enter the great fire and made to taste its burning,
it is he who created the night and the day, the sun and the moon, each swimming in an orbit.
and those who believe in allah and all his noble messengers, are the truly sincere; and are witness upon others, before their lord; for them is their reward, and their light; and those who disbelieved and denied our signs, are the people of hell.
do not strain your eyes towards the worldly benefits we have bestowed on some of them, nor grieve on their account. lower your wing of mercy for the believers
while the hereafter is better and more enduring.
but speak to him nicely. perhaps he will remember, or have some fear.”
thus it was; and we made the children of israel possess them.
no indeed! they say, "we have found our fathers following a certain course, and we are guided by their footsteps."
god gives greater guidance to those who are guided; and good deeds that endure are better with your lord for reward, and better for consequence.
the worst beasts before allah are those who are deaf, dumb, and do not understand.
then i seized those who disbelieved—so how was my rejection?
he is the creator, the designer, the modeler, and to him belong all virtuous names. all that is in the heavens and the earth glorify him. he is all-majestic and all-wise.
but all things we have enumerated in writing.
that we may bring to life thereby a dead land and give it as drink to those we created of numerous livestock and men.
and allah knoweth that which ye keep secret and that which ye publish.
and believes in al-husna.
what is the matter with them that they evade the reminder
they will ask you for a verdict. say: 'allah rules for you concerning the indirect heir (alkalalah which is), if a person dies, having no children, but he has a sister, she shall receive half of what he leaves, and he is her heir if she has no children. if there are two sisters, they shall receive twothirds of what he leaves, if there are siblings, men and women, for a male like the share of two females. allah clarifies to you, lest you go astray, allah is knowledgeable of everything.
through grace from allah and his favour; and allah is knowing, wise.
they were the people, and they have passed away. theirs the reward for what they did, as yours will be for what you do. you will not be questioned about their deeds.
and when our commandment came, we saved shu'aib and those who believed with him by a mercy from us. and as-saihah (torment - awful cry, etc.) seized the wrong-doers, and they lay (dead) prostrate in their homes.
he has created the heavens and the earth with truth, and he shaped you and made good your shapes, and to him is the final return.
and whoso changeth (the will) after he hath heard it - the sin thereof is only upon those who change it. lo! allah is hearer, knower.
they ascribe to god that which even they themselves do not like and their lying tongues say that their end will be virtuous. their share will certainly be hell fire to which they are earnestly heading.
as for those who turn back in their footsteps after the guidance of allah has become clear to them, it was satan who tempted them, and allah has respited them.
consider, how they have lied against their own souls and have lost their gods.
it will be proclaimed to the faithless: ‘surely, allah’s outrage [towards you] is greater than your outrage towards yourselves, as you were invited to faith, but you disbelieved.’
that god may distinguish the corrupt from the good, and place the corrupt one upon another, and so heap them up all together, and put them in gehenna; those are the losers.
this is because they remained opposed to allah and his noble messenger; and whoever remains opposed to allah, (and his noble messenger) – then indeed allah’s punishment is severe.
we gave these as an inheritance to other people.
such is he, the knower of all things, hidden and open, the exalted (in power), the merciful;-
and he it is who sends down water from the cloud, then we bring forth with it buds of all (plants), then we bring forth from it green (foliage) from which we produce grain piled up (in the ear); and of the palm-tree, of the sheaths of it, come forth clusters (of dates) within reach, and gardens of grapes and olives and pomegranates, alike and unlike; behold the fruit of it when it yields the fruit and the ripening of it; most surely there are signs in this for a people who believe.
satan has got the better of them. and made them forget to remember god. indeed they belong to satan's faction. will not satan's faction perish?
and if allah had willed, he could have made them one nation, but he admits whom he wills to his mercy. and the zalimun (polytheists and wrong-doers, etc.) will have neither a wali (protector) nor a helper.
o ye who believe! give your response to allah and his messenger, when he calleth you to that which will give you life; and know that allah cometh in between a man and his heart, and that it is he to whom ye shall (all) be gathered.
they said: 'are we to follow a mortal who is one of us? then indeed, we would surely be in error and insane.
whoever renounces faith in god after having believed—except for someone who is compelled, while his heart rests securely in faith—but whoever willingly opens up his heart to disbelief—upon them falls wrath from god, and for them is a tremendous torment.
incumbent it is upon me that i speak naught respecting allah save the truth; surely i have brought you an evidence from your lord; wherefore let then go with me the children of isra'il.
and fight them until there is no oppression, and worship becomes devoted to god alone. but if they cease, then let there be no hostility except against the oppressors.
who taught the quran --
he said, “go down from it, altogether; some of you enemies of some others. but whenever guidance comes to you from me, whoever follows my guidance, will not go astray, nor suffer.
exalt the name of your lord, the most high,
and permission shall not be given to them so that they should offer excuses.
and that his efforts will be witnessed.
but those who believed (in the oneness of allah - islamic monotheism), and worked righteousness - we tax not any person beyond his scope, such are the dwellers of paradise. they will abide therein.
that, is for what your hands have forwarded. and allah is never unjust to his worshipers.
as for those who avoid the worship of idols, and devote themselves to god—theirs is the good news. so give good news to my servants.
one with whom was knowledge of the scripture said: "i will bring it to you within the twinkling of an eye!" then when [sulaiman (solomon)] saw it placed before him, he said: "this is by the grace of my lord to test me whether i am grateful or ungrateful! and whoever is grateful, truly, his gratitude is for (the good of) his ownself, and whoever is ungrateful, (he is ungrateful only for the loss of his ownself). certainly! my lord is rich (free of all wants), bountiful."
so for one whose scales prove heavy,
naught of distress befalleth the earth or your persons but it is inscribed in the book even before we have created them. verily with allahs that is easy.
he will say: do not quarrel in my presence, and indeed i gave you the threatening beforehand:
and we remove whatever rancour may be in their breasts. as brethren, face to face, (they rest) on couches raised.
so they returned with the favour and munificence from allah, in that no harm reached them; they followed what pleased allah; and allah is extremely munificent.
but when he bestowed his favours on them they grew niggardly, and turned away in aversion.
we know those of you who press forward, and we know the laggards,
and whoever repents and acts righteously indeed turns to allah with due penitence).
surely it sends up sparks like palaces,
the true religion with allah is islam. the people of the book adopted many different ways rather than follow the true way of islam even after the knowledge of truth had reached them, and this merely to commit excesses against one another. let him who refuses to follow the ordinances and directives of allah know that allah is swift in his reckoning.
it is he who sendeth down rain from the skies: with it we produce vegetation of all kinds: from some we produce green (crops), out of which we produce grain, heaped up (at harvest); out of the date-palm and its sheaths (or spathes) (come) clusters of dates hanging low and near: and (then there are) gardens of grapes, and olives, and pomegranates, each similar (in kind) yet different (in variety): when they begin to bear fruit, feast your eyes with the fruit and the ripeness thereof. behold! in these things there are signs for people who believe.
afterwards we drowned the others.
so they went off, whispering to one another,
“and we will settle you in the land after them. that is for him who fears my majesty, and fears my threats.”
migrate – whether willingly or with a heavy heart and fight in allah's cause with your wealth and your lives; this is better for you, if you realise.
by those [angels] lined up in rows
“o my fellow inmates! one of you will serve his master wine; while the other will be crucified, and the birds will eat from his head. thus the matter you are inquiring about is settled.”

and when a sign came to them, they said, 'we will not believe until we are given the like of what god's messengers were given.' god knows very well where to place his message; and humiliation in god's sight shall befall the sinners, and a terrible chastisement, for what they devised.
in the beautiful paradise.
surely those who disbelieve in the reminder when it comes to them, and most surely it is a mighty book:
and the folk of abraham and the folk of lot;
a favor from your lord. that is the supreme salvation.
so put thy trust in allah: for thou art on (the path of) manifest truth.
and those who disbelieve shall not cease to be in doubt concerning it until the hour overtakes them suddenly, or there comes on them the chastisement of a destructive day.
we never sent a messenger before you except that we revealed to him saying: 'there is no god except me, therefore, worship me'
"until there came to us (the death) that is certain."
and in the alternation of night and day and that which allah sendeth down of provision from the heaven and thereby quickeneth the earth after the death thereof and the turning about of the winds, are signs unto a people who reflect.
(moses) said: "the lord of the east and the lord of the west and all that lies between them, if you have sense."
say (o muhammad saw): "allah rescues you from it and from all (other) distresses, and yet you worship others besides allah."
god is not loath to advance the similitude of a gnat or a being more contemptible; and those who believe know whatever is from the lord is true. but those who disbelieve say: "what does god mean by this parable?" he causes some to err this way, and some he guides; yet he turns away none but those who transgress,
it is a revelation from the lord of the worlds.
and those whose (deeds) are lighter in the scale shall perish for violating our signs.
if, then, allah bring thee back to any of them, and they ask thy permission to come out (with thee), say: "never shall ye come out with me, nor fight an enemy with me: for ye preferred to sit inactive on the first occasion: then sit ye (now) with those who lag behind."

and remember our slave ayub (job), when he invoked his lord (saying): "verily! shaitan (satan) has touched me with distress (by losing my health) and torment (by losing my wealth)!

and those of the left hand, how wretched are those of the left hand!
call (the pagans) to the path of your lord through wisdom and good advice and argue with them in the best manner. god knows well about those who stray from his path and those who seek guidance.
and whatsoever it be wherein ye differ the decision thereof is with allah; such is allah, my lord: in him put my trust and unto him i turn in penitenance.
if ye twain turn unto allah repentant, (ye have cause to do so) for your hearts desired (the ban); and if ye aid one another against him (muhammad) then lo! allah, even he, is his protecting friend, and gabriel and the righteous among the believers; and furthermore the angels are his helpers.
not equal are the two seas; this is sweet, grateful to taste, delicious to drink, and that is salt, bitter to the tongue. yet of both you eat fresh flesh, and bring forth out of it ornaments for you to wear; and thou mayest see the ships cleaving through it, that you may seek of his bounty, and so haply you will be thankful.

say: 'god is witness between me and you, and this koran has been revealed to me that i may warn you thereby, and whomsoever it may reach. do you indeed testify that there are other gods with god?' say: 'i do not testify.' say: 'he is only one god, and i am quit of that you associate.'

"'verily it has been revealed to us that the penalty (awaits) those who reject and turn away.'"
then which of the blessings of your lord will you both (jinns and men) deny?
and the human asks: "what is the matter with it?"
and it is he who has made you successors upon the earth and has raised some of you above others in degrees [of rank] that he may try you through what he has given you. indeed, your lord is swift in penalty; but indeed, he is forgiving and merciful.
said one of them, more just (than the rest): "did i not say to you, 'why not glorify (allah)?'"
they will answer: “we were not among those who observed prayer,
that is because they follow what angers allah and hate his pleasure, therefore he has annulled their deeds.

even if every soul that has sinned possessed whatever is on the earth, it would surely offer it to ransom itself, and feel repentant on seeing the punishment. yet the sentence would be passed with justice, and not one will be wronged.
and how many a city did give reins to, while it wronged itself, then took hold of it! and unto me is the return.
have you not seen how god propels the clouds, then brings them together, then piles them into a heap, and you see rain drops emerging from its midst? how he brings down loads of hail from the sky, striking with it whomever he wills, and diverting it from whomever he wills? the flash of its lightening almost snatches the sight away.
and let them fear, those who, if they would themselves leave behind helpless offspring, they would surely have been fearful on their account. let them, then, fear allah and make the right statement.

lo! those who hide aught of the scripture which allah hath revealed and purchase a small gain therewith, they eat into their bellies nothing else than fire. allah will not speak to them on the day of resurrection, nor will he make them grow. theirs will be a painful doom.
when the relationships are suspended.
those who devour usury will not stand except as stand one whom the evil one by his touch hath driven to madness. that is because they say: "trade is like usury," but allah hath permitted trade and forbidden usury. those who after receiving direction from their lord, desist, shall be pardoned for the past; their case is for allah (to judge); but those who repeat (the offence) are companions of the fire: they will abide therein (for ever).

but she in whose house he resided wished to seduce him and, closing the doors, said: "come into me. "god forbid!" he said; "he is my master who has approved my stay. surely those who act wrongly do not prosper."

he presents to you an example from yourselves. do you have among those whom your right hands possess any partners in what we have provided for you so that you are equal therein would fear them as your fear of one another [within a partnership]? thus do we detail the verses for a people who use reason.
yet in his benevolence he made you night and day that you may rest and seek his bounty during them, and haply maybe grateful."

o messenger, deliver what is sent down to you from your lord; if you do not, you will not have conveyed his message. allah protects you from the people. allah does not guide the nation, the unbelievers.
o people, an example is presented, so listen to it. indeed, those you invoke besides allah will never create [as much as] a fly, even if they gathered together for that purpose. and if the fly should steal away from them a [tiny] thing, they could not recover it from him. weak are the pursuer and pursued.
he it is who gives life and causes death, and to him shall you all be returned.
so, call you (o muhammad saw and the believers) upon (or invoke) allah making (your) worship pure for him (alone) (by worshipping none but him and by doing religious deeds sincerely for allah's sake only and not to show-off and not to set up rivals with him in worship). however much the disbelievers (in the oneness of allah) may hate (it).

see how they lie against themselves, and (how) the thing which they devised hath failed them!
have you not seen those who were given a portion of the scripture, purchasing error [in exchange for it] and wishing you would lose the way?
let them then produce a recital like unto it (the quran) if they are truthful.
how many creatures cannot fend for themselves! god provides for them and for you. he is the all hearing, the all knowing.
and we tax not any person except according to his capacity, and with us is a record which speaks the truth, and they will not be wronged.
then indeed you, the astray, the deniers –
and gardens of entwined growth.
say, "it may be that a part of what you would hasten on is close behind you."

then, indeed your lord, to those who emigrated after they had been compelled [to renounce their religion] and thereafter fought [for the cause of allah] and were patient - indeed, your lord, after that, is forgiving and merciful
those to whom we have given the book (such as 'abdullah bin salam and other jews who embraced islam), rejoice at what has been revealed unto you (i.e. the quran), but there are among the confederates (from the jews and pagans) those who reject a part thereof. say (o muhammad saw): "i am commanded only to worship allah (alone) and not to join partners with him. to him (alone) i call and to him is my return."

[observing saum (fasts)] for a fixed number of days, but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number (should be made up) from other days. and as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man, etc.), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a miskin (poor person) (for every day). but whoever does good of his own accord, it is better for him. and that you fast, it is better for you if only you know.
and thou mightest have seen the sun when it rose move away from their cave to the right, and when it set go past them on the left, and they were in the cleft thereof. that was (one) of the portents of allah. he whom allah guideth, he indeed is led aright, and he whom he sendeth astray, for him thou wilt not find a guiding friend.
we sent not a messenger, but to be obeyed, in accordance with the will of allah. if they had only, when they were unjust to themselves, come unto thee and asked allah's forgiveness, and the messenger had asked forgiveness for them, they would have found allah indeed oft-returning, most merciful.
then as for him whose measure of good deeds is heavy,
so he built the ark; and when groups of his people passed by him, they scoffed at him. he said to them: "though you laugh at us (now), we shall laugh at you, as you are laughing at us.
let them, then, laugh little, and weep much at the contemplation of the punishment for the evil they have committed.

(are these) like those who abide in the fire and who are made to drink boiling water so it rends their bowels asunder.
when waves cover them like awnings; they invoke allah, putting exclusive faith in him. but when he delivers them towards land, [only] some of them remain unswerving. no one will impugn our signs except an ungrateful traitor.
who are humble in their prayers;
therefore turn away from them for some time.
surely we shall cast those who reject our signs into the fire; and as often as their skins are burnt out, we shall give them other skins in exchange that they may fully taste the chastisement. surely allah is all-mighty, all-wise.
let not the vicissitude (of the success) of those who disbelieve, in the land, deceive thee (o muhammad).
it is he who has sent forth his messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to uplift it above every religion, no matter how much the idolaters hate it.
those who charge with slander those believing women, who are chaste but simple souls, are accursed in this world and in the hereafter: there is a great punishment for them.
how then if we brought from each people a witness, and we brought thee as a witness against these people!
when the unbelievers see thee, they treat thee not except with ridicule. "is this," (they say), "the one who talks of your gods?" and they blaspheme at the mention of (allah) most gracious!
when the sentence will have been passed upon them for their wickedness, they will not be able to say a word.
the day you see it every suckling female will forget her suckling, and every pregnant female will discharge her burden. you will see men drunk, yet it will not be intoxication. the torment of god will be severe.

i do not ask you any reward for it; my reward lies only with the lord of all the worlds.

and do not speak of those who are slain in allah's way as dead; nay, (they are) alive, but you do not perceive.
his wealth will not avail him when he perishes.
for we have written in the psalms, after the remembrance, 'the earth shall be the inheritance of my righteous servants.'
their condition may be described in a parable: a man kindled a fire and when it illuminated all around him, allah took away the light from their eyes and left them in utter darkness, where they could not see anything.
and those who believe and work righteous works, anon we shall cause them to enter the gardens whereunder rivers flow as abiders therein for ever. for them shall be spouses purified, and we shall cause them to enter a sheltering shade.
knower of the hidden and the manifest! the great! the exalted.
the great doer of what he will.
muhammad is the messenger of allah; and those with him are forceful against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves. you see them bowing and prostrating [in prayer], seeking bounty from allah and [his] pleasure. their mark is on their faces from the trace of prostration. that is their description in the torah. and their description in the gospel is as a plant which produces its offshoots and strengthens them so they grow firm and stand upon their stalks, delighting the sowers - so that allah may enrage by them the disbelievers. allah has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds among them forgiveness and a great reward.
lodge them (your wives) where you lived together if you can afford it. do not annoy them so as to make life intolerable for them. if they are pregnant, provide them with maintenance until their delivery. pay their wage if they breast-feed your children and settle your differences lawfully. if you are unable to settle them, let another person breast-feed the child.
"o my sons! go you and enquire about yusuf (joseph) and his brother, and never give up hope of allah's mercy. certainly no one despairs of allah's mercy, except the people who disbelieve."

that left nothing it came upon, but made it as stuff decayed.
your companion has neither strayed nor is he deluded;
and its shade will cover them, and its fruit clusters brought down low for them.

but those among them who are well-grounded in knowledge, and the believers, believe in what has been sent down to you (muhammad saw) and what was sent down before you, and those who perform as-salat (iqamat-as-salat), and give zakat and believe in allah and in the last day, it is they to whom we shall give a great reward.

"verily, i fear for you the torment of a great day."

and do not marry those [women] whom your fathers married, except what has already occurred. indeed, it was an immorality and hateful [to allah] and was evil as a way.
and in thamud, when it was said to them, "enjoy yourselves for a time."

surely those, the men and the women, who make freewill offerings and have lent to god a good loan, it shall be multiplied for them, and theirs shall be a generous wage.

in their wake, we sent a succession of our messengers, and raised jesus, son of mary, after all of them, and bestowed upon him the evangel, and we set tenderness and mercy in the hearts of those that followed him. as for monasticism, it is they who invented it; we did not prescribe it for them. they themselves invented it in pursuit of allah's good pleasure, and then they did not observe it as it ought to have been observed. so we gave their reward to those of them that believed. but many of them are wicked.

and by the mount sinai,
do you find it strange that a message should come from your lord, through one of your own men, to warn you? remember how he made you successors of noah's people, and increased you greatly in stature. remember the favours of god, so that you may prosper."

god has been true in his promise towards you when you blasted them by his leave; until you lost heart, and quarrelled about the matter, and were rebellious, after he had shown you that you longed for. some of you there are that desire this world, and some of you there are desire the next world. then he turned you from them, that he might try you; and he has pardoned you; and god is bounteous to the believers.
and we revealed to you the book, with truth, confirming the scripture that preceded it, and superseding it. so judge between them according to what god revealed, and do not follow their desires if they differ from the truth that has come to you. for each of you we have assigned a law and a method. had god willed, he could have made you a single nation, but he tests you through what he has given you. so compete in righteousness. to god is your return, all of you; then he will inform you of what you had disputed.
so he came forth unto his people from the sanctuary, then he made signal to them, 'give you glory at dawn and evening.'
god will save the pious ones because of their virtuous deeds. no hardship will touch them nor will they be grieved.

o mankind! if you are in doubt about the resurrection, then verily! we have created you (i.e. adam) from dust, then from a nutfah (mixed drops of male and female sexual discharge i.e. offspring of adam), then from a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood) then from a little lump of flesh, some formed and some unformed (miscarriage), that we may make (it) clear to you (i.e. to show you our power and ability to do what we will). and we cause whom we will to remain in the wombs for an appointed term, then we bring you out as infants, then (give you growth) that you may reach your age of full strength. and among you there is he who dies (young), and among you there is he who is brought back to the miserable old age, so that he knows nothing after having known. and you see the earth barren, but when we send down water (rain) on it, it is stirred (to life), it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth).
[they will be told,] ‘yes, my signs certainly came to you, but you denied them and acted arrogantly and you were among the faithless.’

"o john! hold the book with all your strength." we had bestowed wisdom upon him while he was still a child;

so fear you god, and obey you me;
and they say: we are more (than you) in wealth and children. we are not the punished!
and many of the devils (we also made obedient to him) who dived for him, and did many other things; and we kept watch over them.
and we gave them our communications, but they turned aside from them;
and moses said, "if you should disbelieve, you and whoever is on the earth entirely - indeed, allah is free of need and praiseworthy."
much will they listen and much will they see, on the day when they come to us, but today the unjust are in open error.
for (they fear) he might make what they differed about plain to them, and that the infidels may realise that they were liars.
say thou unto the believers that they shall lower their sights and guard their private parts, that is cleaner for them; verlly allah is aware of that which they perform.

god is too glorious to be described as they describe him

for we had certainly sent unto them a book, based on knowledge, which we explained in detail,- a guide and a mercy to all who believe.

indeed, the example of jesus to allah is like that of adam. he created him from dust; then he said to him, "be," and he was.
those who denied our signs and the meeting of the hereafter - their deeds have become worthless. are they recompensed except for what they used to do?
and they worship those instead of allah regarding whom he has not sent down any proof, and those regarding whom they themselves do not have any knowledge; and there are no supporters for the unjust.
he frowned and turned away,
and yet, instead of god, they serve what neither profits them nor harms them. the disbeliever has always turned his back on his lord.
your god is one god. there is no god except he. he is the merciful, the most merciful.
and the time for the fulfilment of the true promise of allah draws near, whereupon the eyes of those who disbelieved will stare in fear, and they will say: "woe to us, we were indeed heedless of this; nay, we were wrongdoers."

(as for) those who dispute the verses of allah without authority having been given to them, there is nothing in their chests but pride; that, they shall never attain. therefore seek refuge in allah, surely, he is the hearer, the seer.

they will be given pure wine to drink, which is kept preserved, sealed.
they said: o shu'aib! does your prayer enjoin you that we should forsake what our fathers worshipped or that we should not do what we please with regard to our property? forsooth you are the forbearing, the right-directing one.
and to madyan their fellow man shuaib; he said, “o my people! worship allah – there is no other true god except him; and do not make reductions in measure and weight – indeed i see you prosperous, and i fear the punishment of the besieging day (of resurrection) upon you.”
‘o abraham, let this matter alone! your lord’s edict has certainly come, and an irrevocable punishment shall overtake them.’

allah is the creator of everything; he is the guardian over everything.
but they who have earned [blame for] evil doings - the recompense of an evil deed is its equivalent, and humiliation will cover them. they will have from allah no protector. it will be as if their faces are covered with pieces of the night - so dark [are they]. those are the companions of the fire; they will abide therein eternally.
the example of those who were entrusted with the taurat, and did not carry out its commands, is like the donkey carrying books; what a wretched example is of the people who denied the signs of allah; and allah does not guide the unjust.
he, whose is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and who did not take to himself a son, and who has no associate in the kingdom, and who created everything, then ordained for it a measure.
shu'ayb said to them, "will you not fear god?

this abode of the hereafter – we make it for those who do not wish greatness in the land nor turmoil; and the hereafter is only for the pious.

some people consider certain things equal to god and love them just as one should love god. however, the strongest of the believers' love is their love of god. had the unjust been able to reflect about their condition, when facing the torment, they would have had no doubt that to god belongs all-power and that he is stern in his retribution.
if you do any good openly or in secret, or pardon someone’s evil – then indeed allah is oft forgiving, able.
had we wished, we would have surely raised him by their means, but he clung to the earth and followed his [base] desires. so his parable is that of a dog: if you make for it, it lolls out its tongue, and if you let it alone, it lolls out its tongue. such is the parable of the people who deny our signs. so recount these narratives, so that they may reflect.

“he wishes to expel you out of your land by his magic; so what is your advice?”

gehenna, wherein they are roasted - an evil cradling!
when those who disbelieved had put into their hearts chauvinism - the chauvinism of the time of ignorance. but allah sent down his tranquillity upon his messenger and upon the believers and imposed upon them the word of righteousness, and they were more deserving of it and worthy of it. and ever is allah, of all things, knowing.

when thy sister went and said: shall i show you one who will nurse him? and we restored thee to thy mother that her eyes might be refreshed and might not sorrow. and thou didst kill a man and we delivered thee from great distress, and tried thee with a heavy trial. and thou didst tarry years among the folk of midian. then camest thou (hither) by (my) providence, o moses,
whether thou ask for their forgiveness, or not, (their sin is unforgivable): if thou ask seventy times for their forgiveness, allah will not forgive them: because they have rejected allah and his messenger: and allah guideth not those who are perversely rebellious.

except for those who repent and reform, and hold fast to allah and dedicate their religion [exclusively] to allah. those are with the faithful, and soon allah will give the faithful a great reward.
and if their turning away is distressful for thee, why, if thou canst seek out a hole in the earth, or a ladder in heaven, to bring them some sign but had god willed, he would have gathered them to the guidance; so be not thou one of the ignorant.
but those who believe and do good works are the people of paradise; for ever they shall live in it.
verily it is we who have revealed the book to thee in truth: so serve allah, offering him sincere devotion.
have we not made the earth (as a place) to draw together.
and o my people, ask forgiveness of your lord and then repent to him. he will send [rain from] the sky upon you in showers and increase you in strength [added] to your strength. and do not turn away, [being] criminals."
then we inspired in him, saying: make the ship under our eyes and our inspiration. then, when our command cometh and the oven gusheth water, introduce therein of every (kind) two spouses, and thy household save him thereof against whom the word hath already gone forth. and plead not with me on behalf of those who have done wrong. lo! they will be drowned.
does man think that he will be left alone, unquestioned?
the love of [worldly] allures, including women and children, accumulated piles of gold and silver, horses of mark, livestock, and farms has been made to seem decorous to mankind. those are the wares of the life of this world, but the goodness of one’s ultimate destination lies near allah.
believers, be god's helpers, as jesus, son of mary, said to the disciples, "who will be my helpers in the cause of god?" the disciples said, "we shall be god's helpers." some of the children of israel believed in him and some denied the truth; we supported the believers against their enemies and they triumphed over them.
the seed of those we bore with noah; he was a thankful servant.
are ye harder to create or the heaven which he hath builded?
therefor (o muhammad), praise the name of thy lord, the tremendous.
degrading (some) and exalting (others);
they also have a sin against me, and i fear they will slay me.'
besides the other burdens that they will have to carry, they will certainly be loaded with the burden of their own sins. they will be questioned on the day of judgment about what they had falsely invented.
paradise is not [obtained] by your wishful thinking nor by that of the people of the scripture. whoever does a wrong will be recompensed for it, and he will not find besides allah a protector or a helper.
if you (people) have any doubt about what we have revealed to you (about the day of judgment and other matters of belief), ask those who read the book that was revealed (to the prophets who lived) before you. the truth has certainly come to you from your lord. thus, do not doubt it (in your heart),
over it are nineteen [angels].
and your lord comes with the angels, rank upon rank,
and [recall] when we made an appointment with moses for forty nights. then you took [for worship] the calf after him, while you were wrongdoers.
he said: then get out of it, for surely you are driven away:
and have made your sleep as a thing for rest.
we narrate unto thee (somewhat) of the story of moses and pharaoh with truth, for folk who believe.
do they not look at the camels, how they are made?-
and when musa (moses) returned to his people, angry and grieved, he said: "what an evil thing is that which you have done (i.e. worshipping the calf) during my absence. did you hasten and go ahead as regards the matter of your lord (you left his worship)?" and he threw down the tablets and seized his brother by (the hair of) his head and dragged him towards him. harun (aaron) said: "o son of my mother! indeed the people judged me weak and were about to kill me, so make not the enemies rejoice over me, nor put me amongst the people who are zalimun (wrong-doers)."
all praise is to allah, the maker of the heavens and the earth, who assigns angels as messengers – who have pairs of two, three, four wings; he increases in creation whatever he wills; indeed allah is able to do all things.
then we saved him and those with him in the ship, and made it (the ship) as an ayah (a lesson, a warning, etc.) for the 'alamin (mankind, jinns and all that exists).
so that you may warn these people whose ancestors were not warned, they are therefore unaware.
that is the commandment of allah which he hath sent down unto you. and whosoever feareth allah, he will expiate his misdeeds from him, and will magnify for him his hire.
and he commanded you not that ye should take the angels and the prophets for lords. would he command you to disbelieve after ye had surrendered (to allah)?
and the people of the left hand—and what are the people of the left hand?!
god has decreed, "i and my messenger shall certainly triumph." god is all-powerful and majestic.
where they shall hear no (word) of vanity:
in which will be of every fruit two kinds.
allah knows whatever they call upon other than him; he is the almighty, the wise.
nay! verily, man does transgress all bounds (in disbelief and evil deed, etc.).
and know that among you is allah's apostle; should he obey you in many a matter, you would surely fall into distress, but allah has endeared the faith to you and has made it seemly in your hearts, and he has made hateful to you unbelief and transgression and disobedience; these it is that are the followers of a right way.
those who deny our signs are deaf and dumb, in a manifold darkness. allah leads astray whomever he wishes, and whomever he wishes he puts him on a straight path.
o which of your lord's bounties will you and you deny?
i will soon fling him into hell.
say: o followers of the book! come to an equitable proposition between us and you that we shall not serve any but allah and (that) we shall not associate aught with him, and (that) some of us shall not take others for lords besides allah; but if they turn back, then say: bear witness that we are muslims.
woe to the deniers on that day,
it is satan who instills fear [into you] of his followers; do not fear them. but fear me, if you are true believers.
we mete out death among you, and we are not to be outrun,
if they charge thee with falsehood, say: "my work to me, and yours to you! ye are free from responsibility for what i do, and i for what ye do!"
certainly they sought (to sow) dissension before, and they meditated plots against you until the truth came, and allah's commandment prevailed although they were averse (from it).
then it will be said to those who did wrong, “taste the torment of eternity. will you be rewarded except for what you used to do?”
o you people of the book, our apostle has come to you when apostles had ceased to come long ago, lest you said: "there did not come to us any messenger of good news or of warnings." so now there has reached you a bearer of good tidings and of warnings; for god has the power over all things.
they said, "have you brought us the truth or are you jesting?"
and if anyone disputes with you about him, after the knowledge that has come to you, say, “come, let us call our children and your children, and our women and your women, and ourselves and yourselves, and let us invoke god’s curse on the liars.”
but they said: "o sorcerer, call on your lord for us in accordance with the compact he has made with you. we shall certainly come to guidance."
and recite (o muhammad saw) to them the story of him to whom we gave our ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), but he threw them away, so shaitan (satan) followed him up, and he became of those who went astray.
but satan said, "my lord, grant me respite until the day of resurrection,"
and the mountains stakes?
"i found (there) a woman ruling over them and provided with every requisite; and she has a magnificent throne.
your lord has announced that, he would send against them, until the day of resurrection, those who would inflict terrible suffering upon them. your lord is swift in retribution, yet he is forgiving and merciful.
and that allah may purify the believers [through trials] and destroy the disbelievers.
he asked them, "my people, is my tribe more respectable to you than god whom you have completely ignored? my lord certainly has full control over your deeds.
and those who disbelieve say: "we believe not in this quran nor in that which was before it," but if you could see when the zalimun (polytheists and wrongdoers, etc.) will be made to stand before their lord, how they will cast the (blaming) word one to another! those who were deemed weak will say to those who were arrogant: "had it not been for you, we should certainly have been believers!"
for you therein are many fruits of which you shall eat.
or, is the unseen with them, and they are writing it down!
is the description of paradise, which the righteous are promised, wherein are rivers of water unaltered, rivers of milk the taste of which never changes, rivers of wine delicious to those who drink, and rivers of purified honey, in which they will have from all [kinds of] fruits and forgiveness from their lord, like [that of] those who abide eternally in the fire and are given to drink scalding water that will sever their intestines?
when their brother salih (saleh) said to them: "will you not fear allah and obey him?
their garments of liquid pitch and their faces covered by the fire.
and every soul came, along with a herder and a witness.
if allah took mankind to task by that which they deserve, he would not leave a living creature on the surface of the earth; but he reprieveth them unto an appointed term, and when their term cometh - then verily (they will know that) allah is ever seer of his slaves.
therein abiding, they have all that they desire. it is for thy lord a promise that must be fulfilled.
there was a group of my servants who would say, `our lord, we have believed, so forgive us, and have mercy on us; you are the best of the merciful.'
and when there came to them (the jews), a book (this quran) from allah confirming what is with them [the taurat (torah) and the injeel (gospel)], although aforetime they had invoked allah (for coming of muhammad peace be upon him) in order to gain victory over those who disbelieved, then when there came to them that which they had recognised, they disbelieved in it. so let the curse of allah be on the disbelievers.
yet they attributed to god partners—the sprites—although he created them. and they invented for him sons and daughters, without any knowledge. glory be to him. he is exalted, beyond what they describe.
he said, "my lord, forgive me and my brother and admit us to your mercy. you are the most merciful of the merciful."
that he may make that which the satan casteth forth a temptation for those in whose heart is a disease and whose hearts are hardened--and the wrong-doers are in divergence far-off -
also towards the three who were left behind. then, when the earth, as vast as it is, closed in on them, and their very souls closed in on them, and they realized that there was no refuge from god, except in him, he redeemed them, so that they may repent. god is the redeemer, the merciful.
he it is who has stretched out the earth and has placed in it firm mountains and has caused the rivers to flow. he has made every fruit in pairs, two and two, and he it is who causes the night to cover the day. surely there are signs in these for those who reflect.
thus they planned and we too planned, the while they did not know.
this is the recompense of those who fight against god and his messenger, and hasten about the earth, to do corruption there: they shall be slaughtered, or crucified, or their hands and feet shall alternately be struck off; or they shall be banished from the land. that is a degradation for them in this world; and in the world to come awaits them a mighty chastisement,
"peace be on elijah and his people!"
allah's object also is to purge those that are true in faith and to deprive of blessing those that resist faith.
it is for allah to show the way. some swerve from it, but had he willed, he would have guided all of you.
and you consume inheritance, devouring [it] altogether,
then we made the seed a clot, then we made the clot a lump of flesh, then we made (in) the lump of flesh bones, then we clothed the bones with flesh, then we caused it to grow into another creation, so blessed be allah, the best of the creators.
do they think that we enlarge them in wealth and children,
and that which ye see not.
then his lord chose him and relented towards him, and showed him the way;
shall not be able to tempt anyone away from allah
some of the jews interchange the words from their places and say, “we hear and disobey” – and they say “hear- may you not be able to hear” – and they say “raena (be considerate towards us)” distorting it with their tongues and in order to slander religion; had they said, “we hear and we obey” and “kindly listen to us, o dear prophet,” and “look mercifully upon us, o dear prophet”, it would have been much better for them and more just – but allah has cursed them for their disbelief; so they do not believe except a little.
he has made the night and the day and the sun and the moon subservient to you; and all the stars are subservient to his command. surely in this there are signs for men of understanding.
is not allah sufficient for his slave? yet they try to frighten you with those (whom they worship) besides him! and whom allah sends astray, for him there will be no guide.

but some of the desert arabs believe in allah and the last day, and look on their payments as pious gifts bringing them nearer to allah and obtaining the prayers of the messenger. aye, indeed they bring them nearer (to him): soon will allah admit them to his mercy: for allah is oft-forgiving, most merciful.
and whether ye die or be slain, assuredly unto allah shall ye be gathered.
devote yourselves to god, not associating any partners with him. whoever associates anything with god is like one who falls from heaven and is snatched by the birds or carried away by the wind to a distant place.
there came indeed to them a messenger from amongst them, but they cried him lies; so they were seized by the chastisement while they were evildoers.

and no burdened soul will carry another soul’s burden; and if a burdened soul calls another to share the burden, no one will carry any part of it, even if he is a close relative; o dear prophet (mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), your warning only benefits those who fear their lord without seeing and who keep the prayer established; and whoever cleansed himself, has cleansed for his own benefit; and towards allah only is the return.
they said, 'put him and his brother off a while, and send among the cities musterers,

surely scheming is the work of satan that he may cause the faithful grief; but he cannot harm them unless god dispense. so in god should the believers place their trust.
o prophet! when ye (men) put away women, put them away for their (legal) period and reckon the period, and keep your duty to allah, your lord. expel them not from their houses nor let them go forth unless they commit open immorality. such are the limits (imposed by) allah; and whoso transgresseth allah's limits, he verily wrongeth his soul. thou knowest not: it may be that allah will afterward bring some new thing to pass.
they said: we choose thee not above the clear proofs that have come unto us, and above him who created us. so decree what thou wilt decree. thou wilt end for us only this life of the world.
yet they turned away [from the truth]. so we let loose on them a flood from the dam and replaced their two gardens by two others bearing bitter fruits, tamarisks, and a few lote trees.
allah will say: "this is a day on which the truthful will profit from their truth: theirs are gardens under which rivers flow (in paradise) - they shall abide therein forever. allah is pleased with them and they with him. that is the great success (paradise).
after that you shall surely die,
he will let loose the sky for you in plenteous rain,
for verily, they used not to look for a reckoning.
now when ye meet those who disbelieve, smite their necks until when ye have slain them greatly, then make fast the bonds; then, thereafter let them off either freely or by ransom, until the war layeth down the burthens thereof. that ye shall do. and had allah willed, he would have vindicated himself against them, but he ordained fighting in order that he may prove you one by the other. and those who are slain in the way of allah, he shall not send their works astray.

surely they shall not avail you in the least against allah; and surely the unjust are friends of each other, and allah is the guardian of those who guard (against evil).
and you are lost in play!
say: who guardeth you in the night or in the day from the beneficent? nay, but they turn away from mention of their lord!
they did not form any proper estimate of allah when they said: 'allah has not revealed anything to any man.' ask them: 'the book which moses brought as a light and guidance for men and which you keep in bits and scraps, some of which you disclose while the rest you conceal, even though through it you were taught that which neither you nor your forefathers knew -who was it who revealed it?' say: 'allah!'- and then leave them to sport with their argumentation.

their greeting on the day they meet him is, “peace,” and he has prepared for them a generous reward.
that for known days. but should any of you be sick or on a journey, let it be a [similar] number of other days. those who find it straining shall be liable to atonement by feeding a needy person. should anyone do good of his own accord, that is better for him, and to fast is better for you, should you know.
or show you what we have promised them, for indeed we hold them in our power.
it will be the day whereon in the fire they will be burned

and a full cup.
and that he might punish the hypocrites and the idolaters, both men and women, and those who think evil thoughts of allah. an evil turn (of fortune) will befall them. the wrath of allah is on them, and he has cursed them and prepared for them gehenna (hell), an evil arrival!
that allah may requite each soul according to its deserts; and verily allah is swift in calling to account.
and your lord knows what their hearts conceal, and what they reveal.
perform the prayer at the decline of the sun, until the darkness of the night; and the quran at dawn. the quran at dawn is witnessed.

and the people of noah,- when they rejected the messengers, we drowned them, and we made them as a sign for mankind; and we have prepared for (all) wrong-doers a grievous penalty;-
thus, have we made of you an ummat justly balanced, that ye might be witnesses over the nations, and the messenger a witness over yourselves; and we appointed the qibla to which thou wast used, only to test those who followed the messenger from those who would turn on their heels (from the faith). indeed it was (a change) momentous, except to those guided by allah. and never would allah make your faith of no effect. for allah is to all people most surely full of kindness, most merciful.
on that day, the heavens will be rent asunder. this is the decree of god which has already been ordained.

but why do they come to you for judgment, when they have the torah, in which is god’s law? yet they turn away after that. these are not believers.

they count it as a favour to you that they have embraced islam. say, ‘do not count your embracing of islam as a favour to me. no, it is allah who has done you a favour in that he has guided you to faith, if you are truthful [in your claim].
alif-lam-mim. [these letters are one of the miracles of the quran, and none but allah (alone) knows their meanings].

so fear allah and obey me.
perchance thou art leaving part of what is revealed to thee, and thy breast is straitened by it, because they say, 'why has a treasure not been sent down upon him, or an angel not come with him?' thou art only a warner; and god is a guardian over everything.

and he indeed had warned them of our blow, but they did doubt the warnings.
when he comes to know something of our messages he makes fun of them: for them is shameful punishment.
"peace and salutation to noah among the nations!"
when allah promised you [victory over] one of the two companies, [saying], ‘it is for you,’ you were eager that it should be the one that was unarmed. but allah desires to confirm the truth with his words, and to root out the faithless,
the thing you are promised, that will surely come; you cannot frustrate it.
truly allah chose adam and noah and the descendants of abraham and of 'imran above all mankind.
believers, if you obey a sect of those who were given the book, they will turn you into unbelievers after you have believed.
and [by] the moon when it follows it
those who disbelieve say, “do not listen to this quran, and talk over it, so that you may prevail.”
and they were pursued by a curse in this world and (so they will be) on the day of resurrection. no doubt! verily, 'ad disbelieved in their lord. so away with 'ad, the people of hud.
we have made only angels as the keepers of the fire (for they are the strongest in carrying out our commands). our informing (people) of the numbers of these angels is a trial for the disbelievers. it gives more certainty to the people of the book and strengthens the faith of the believers. the people of the book and the believers have no doubt about it. we have fixed the number to make the disbelievers and those whose hearts are sick say, "what does god mean by such a parable?" thus, god guides and causes to go astray whomever he wants. no one knows about the army of your lord except he himself. this parable is a reminder for mankind.
by the winds sent forth with beneficence.
would that you two (wives of the prophet) had turned to god in repentance. your hearts have sinned. if you conspire with each other against him, know that god is his guardian. gabriel, the righteous (ones) among the believers and the angels will all support him.
even if we sent down the angels to them and the dead spoke to them, and assembled all things in front of them, they would still not believe, unless allah willed it. but most of them are ignorant.

to allah prostrates whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth, including animals and angels, and they are not arrogant.
these shall be given their wage twice over for that they patiently endured, and avert evil with good, and expend of that we have provided them.

and split the earth, splitting,
none of them but denied the messengers, so my retribution was deserved.

so if they believe in the like of that which you believe, then they are rightly guided, but if they turn away, then they are only in opposition. so allah will suffice you against them. and he is the all-hearer, the all-knower.
the prophet has a greater right on the believers than their own selves, his wives are their mothers. kinsmen are closer to one another in the book of allah than to other believers and the emigrants; although you should act honorably towards those you sponsor, that is written in the book
