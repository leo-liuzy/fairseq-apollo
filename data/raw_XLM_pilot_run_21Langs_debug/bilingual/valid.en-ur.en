say: 'we believe in allah and in what is sent down to us and in that which was sent down to abraham, ishmael, isaac, jacob and the tribes, and in that which was given to (prophets) moses and jesus, and the prophets from their lord. we do not differentiate between any of them. to him we are submitters (muslims)'

so when they forgot what they had been admonished of, we opened for them the gates of all [good] things. when they became proud of what they were given, we seized them suddenly, whereat, behold, they were despondent.
by the lote-tree at the farthest boundary,
and they used to hew out dwellings from the hills, (wherein they dwelt) secure.
that indeed is so, as for him who retaliates in proportion to the excess committed against him, and is thereafter again subjected to transgression, allah will surely aid him. verily allah is all-pardoning, all-forgiving.
and prepare against them whatever you are able of power and of steeds of war by which you may terrify the enemy of allah and your enemy and others besides them whom you do not know [but] whom allah knows. and whatever you spend in the cause of allah will be fully repaid to you, and you will not be wronged.

but if they disdain [the worship of allah], those who are near your lord glorify him night and day, and they are not wearied.
but they turned aside, so we sent upon them a torrent of which the rush could not be withstood, and in place of their two gardens we gave to them two gardens yielding bitter fruit and (growing) tamarisk and a few lote-trees.
assuredly they have disbelieved who say: verily god: he is the masih, son of maryam, whereas the masih had said: children of isra'il! worship allah, mine lord and your lord; verily whosoever associateth aught with allah, allah shall surely forbid the garden unto him, and his resort is the fire; and for the wrong-doers there shall be no helpers.
then what (or who) causes you (o disbelievers) to deny the recompense (i.e. day of resurrection)?
lo! the doom of thy lord will surely come to pass;
allah has now lightened it for you, for he knows that there is weakness amongst you. if there are a hundred patient men among you, they shall overcome two hundred; and if there are a thousand, they shall, by the permission of allah, defeat two thousand. allah is with the patient.
tell them: "come, i will read out what your lord has made binding on you: that you make none the equal of god, and be good to your parents, and do not abandon your children out of poverty, for we give you food and we shall provide for them; and avoid what is shameful, whether open or hidden, and do not take a life which god has forbidden, unless for some just cause. these things has god enjoined on you. haply you may understand.

even if they saw lumps falling from the sky they would say: 'a massed cloud'
do they distribute the mercy of your lord? it is we who have apportioned among them their livelihood in the life of this world and have raised some of them above others in degrees [of rank] that they may make use of one another for service. but the mercy of your lord is better than whatever they accumulate.
and in the mornings they would ask for forgiveness;
and we have protected it from every devil expelled [from the mercy of allah]
and the mountains, how they were fixed;
were it not for the grace of god and his mercy upon you in this world and the next, you would have suffered a great affliction for the false accusation.
we bestowed the same favour upon noah. recall, when he cried to us before; we accepted his prayer and delivered him and his household from the great distress

say, ‘who is the lord of the seven heavens and the lord of the great throne?’

and for their houses, doors (of silver), and thrones (of silver) on which they could recline,
then a mighty blast quite justly overtook them, and we reduced them to a rubble. so away with the wrong-doing folk!
do not obey the unbelievers and the hypocrites, pay no attention to their hurt. put your trust in allah; allah suffices as a guardian.
and we have given you (mankind) power in the earth, and appointed for you therein livelihoods. little give ye thanks!
which is witnessed by those brought near [to allah].
or, benefit they you or hurt they you?
the chiefs of the unbelievers among his people said: "he is no more than a man like yourselves: his wish is to assert his superiority over you: if allah had wished (to send messengers), he could have sent down angels; never did we hear such a thing (as he says), among our ancestors of old."
and said one of them (the two women): "o my father! hire him! verily, the best of men for you to hire is the strong, the trustworthy."
and whenever they passed by them, used to wink at each other (in mockery);

gardens and grapevines
there is no state you are in, whether reading from the qur'an, or doing something else, but we are watching you as you are engaged in it. there is not the weight of an atom on the earth and in the heavens that is hidden from your lord, nor is there anything smaller or greater than this but is recorded in the perspicuous book.
and recall when moosa said to his assistant, “i will not give up until i reach the place where the two seas meet or until i have progressed for ages.”
she said, “this is he on whose account you used to insult me; and indeed i tried to entice him, so he safeguarded himself; and indeed if he does not do what i tell him to, he will surely be imprisoned, and will surely be humiliated.”
and [mention, o muhammad], the day we will gather them all together - then we will say to those who associated others with allah, "[remain in] your place, you and your 'partners.' " then we will separate them, and their "partners" will say, "you did not used to worship us,
there they shall hear no idle talk, but only 'peace.' there they shall have their provision at dawn and evening.
and of them are some who hearken unto thee and we have set over their hearts veils lest they understand it, and in their ears heaviness, and though they see any sign they will not believe therein: in as much as when they come to thee, they dispute with thee. then who disbelieve say: this is naught but the fables of the ancients.
and obey god, and his messenger, and do not quarrel together, and so lose heart, and your power depart; and be patient; surely god is with the patient.

(and remember) when you ran away (dreadfully) without even casting a side glance at anyone, and the messenger (muhammad saw) was in your rear calling you back. there did allah give you one distress after another by way of requital to teach you not to grieve for that which had escaped you, nor for that which had befallen you. and allah is well-aware of all that you do.

say, “who has forbidden the adornment of allah which he has brought forth for his bondmen, and the good food?” say, “that is for the believers in this world, and on the day of resurrection it will be for them only”; this is how we explain our verses in detail for people of knowledge.

and the earth bringeth forth her burthens,

o believers, when you negotiate a debt for a fixed term, draw up an agreement in writing, though better it would be to have a scribe write it faithfully down; and no scribe should refuse to write as god has taught him, and write what the borrower dictates, and have fear of god, his lord, and not leave out a thing. if the borrower is deficient of mind or infirm, or unable to explain, let the guardian explain judiciously; and have two of your men to act as witnesses; but if two men are not available, then a man and two women you approve, so that in case one of them is confused the other may prompt her. when the witnesses are summoned they should not refuse (to come). but do not neglect to draw up a contract, big or small, with the time fixed for paying back the debt. this is more equitable in the eyes of god, and better as evidence and best for avoiding doubt. but if it is a deal about some merchandise requiring transaction face to face, there is no harm if no (contract is drawn up) in writing. have witnesses to the deal, (and make sure) that the scribe or the witness is not harmed. if he is, it would surely be sinful on your part. and have fear of god, for god gives you knowledge, and god is aware of everything.
