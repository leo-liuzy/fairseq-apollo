But are indices, granular and fast, always sensible? Well, rather like search engines, indices are here to stay. Still, no one would index a typical story or newspaper article – we read it from the beginning to the end (for the story) or until we’ve learned enough (for the article). With many reference works, necessary context only comes from looking at several pages, at least. Granular indexing actually has a cost, and that cost is loss of context.

Are you spending increasing amounts on either compliance controls or fines from need of compliance controls? Deutsche Bank was recently fined a record £163 million for failing to maintain an adequate anti-money laundering (AML) control framework for several years, and it is not an anomaly. Humans manufacture 10 errors for every 100 steps of a manual process, a key intuition for enterprises to respect technologies such as RPA.

However, the SDGs themselves have met with considerable criticism. Important points range from the half-baked concept to implementation constraints and unclarities of the governance system. Though specific goals and targets are defined clearly, the pathways that are needed to achieve them are not. Hence, it is essential to ensure that development paths chosen for implementations are technically feasible, financially affordable and – most important – not environmentally harmful. Those in charge must therefore rise to massive challenges.

Hey, Wisconsin! Just because I was throwing some fun words at you a couple days ago about winter is not reason to throw winter at us.
